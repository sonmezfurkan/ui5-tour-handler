# ui5-tour-handler
A small repository to showcase the idea of a quick UI tour for UI5 applications.

 > __Note__
 > This is just playing around and testing ideas, in no way this is a finished product.

You can find the initial state of the application in the [starter](./starter/) folder and the finished version in the [finished](./finished/) folder.

To run either version:

 - Clone the repository
 - run `npm install`
 - run `npm start`
